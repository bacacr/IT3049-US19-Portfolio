        <p>
            Hello All, my name is Colin and I am a 4th year Software Developer. 
            I am from Cleveland, Ohio where I am diehard Cleveland sports fan.
            At a young age I had a love for computers and followed my path to UC 
            to further educate myself and get that degree that is so coveted. I 
            love to be outside and with friends and family. I love playing sports 
            and will play anything with a ball. Life has thrown me many curveballs 
            but luckily I have played baseball since i was little and conquered 
            through those.
